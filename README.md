# Data Bootcamp

## Purpose

A teaching and reference tool for a small cohort of STEM students seeking to learn the basics of data science and ML.

## What is Data Science?

Data science combines statistical analysis, computational methods, and domain expertise to extract insights from data and inform decisionâ€‘making.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of data science focused on algorithms that learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task.
